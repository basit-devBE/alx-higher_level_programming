## Introduction

In JavaScript, objects, scopes, and closures are fundamental concepts that every developer should understand. Objects allow us to create complex data structures, while scopes define the accessibility of variables. Closures, on the other hand, enable us to create functions with persistent data.

This directory provides exercises and examples to help you grasp these concepts and improve your JavaScript skills.

## Topics Covered

- Creating and manipulating objects
- Understanding object properties and methods
- Working with different types of scopes
- Exploring closures and their applications
