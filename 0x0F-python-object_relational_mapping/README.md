## Introduction

In software development, working with databases is a common task. Traditionally, developers have used SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with relational databases. However, writing raw SQL queries can be cumbersome and error-prone.

ORM provides a higher-level abstraction over the database, allowing developers to work with objects instead of writing SQL queries directly. It maps the objects in the application to the tables in the database, providing an intuitive and efficient way to perform database operations.

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to using ORM in Python, covering popular libraries such as SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, and Peewee.

## Installation

To use ORM in Python, you need to install the appropriate library. Here are the installation instructions for some popular ORM libraries:

- SQLAlchemy: `pip install SQLAlchemy`
- Django ORM: `pip install Django`
- Peewee: `pip install peewee`

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system before installing the libraries.

## Usage

To use ORM in your Python project, you need to import the library and establish a connection to the database. Once the connection is established, you can define your models, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and execute complex queries using the ORM library's API.

Here's a basic example of using SQLAlchemy to perform CRUD operations:

```python
